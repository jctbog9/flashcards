# flashcards

This is an application built for those studying programming. 

This terminal-friendly application takes an assigned dataset containing flash cards and presents the user with words and definitions seperately. Once a user has seen the word, they may provide input which the app will then receive and present the answer (back of the card)

# To run the app:
- Navigate to the directory that this application is housed in using your terminal
- Run the code `ruby flashcards.rb` to begin using the flashcards
- Press enter to continue through the deck and view the next flashcard/the answer to your current word
